A desktop application that allows users to upload or browse images sort them into collections. Each image is known as a
“pin” and these are sorted into “Boards”. Firstly to set up a personal user, you will need to sign up for an account.
After that, you will be asked about your interest, this allows the app to recommend to follow people with similar areas
of interest as well as populate your feed. The Pinterest app works as a visual bookmarking site. You are given the
option to pin images to your chosen Board. You can also upload your own images to your Boards.
